	<p><h2>Design</h2> (from the English design - to design, draw, conceive, as well as a project, plan, drawing) - the activity of designing the aesthetic properties of industrial products ("artistic design"), as well as the result of this activity (for example, in such phrases as " car design")[1].

<p>It is believed that in a broader sense, design is not only called upon for artistic design, but also must participate in solving broader socio-technical problems of the functioning of production, consumption, the existence of people in an objective environment, by rationally constructing its visual and functional properties [1].</p>

<p>The theoretical basis of design is technical aesthetics[2].

The term "industrial design" was approved by the decision of the first general assembly of ICSID (International Council of Societies of Industrial Design, International Council of Industrial Design Organizations) in 1959; the term "design" is a professional abbreviation for the term "industrial design"[1].

A designer is an artist-constructor[2], a person engaged in artistic and technical activities in various industries (including an architect, designer, illustrator, designer of posters and other advertising graphics, web designer).

The English-language literature of the beginning of the 21st century understands the word "design" as style, and project, and design, and actually "design" - a professional activity, along with architecture or engineering design [3].</p>
